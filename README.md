# Automation
Code to practice automation with Java and Selenium using Supreme as an example.
What the code does so far is that, with the Supreme item link, it is able to choose a size and be able to check out as well as put certain information.

What it needs for improvement is that it needs to be able to search from the shop link and find a certain item as well as being able to fully commit and buy the item within a certain time limit.
